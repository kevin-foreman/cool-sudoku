# Cool-Sudoku 

Simple Interactive Sudoku Application

## Description 
As a consumer of games and a lover of logic,

We wanted to create a game that would be fun yet challenging. Something that would spark intrest and create a love for the game of Sudoku. 

We wanted our game to apeal to the first time user, the novice and those that may have a little more experience. 

Our game is simple yet challenging and we belive it is just the right stepping stone to begin a love of Sudoku.
